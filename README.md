I am a Superior Technician of Telecommunications and IT,
future software engineer and current Software Developer at Ingenia a Babel Company

I like to learn new technologies, contribute to open source projects, help colleagues and create technologies to lift people, I am starting to build a community.

Some technologies I enjoy working with include Angular, Java, MeanStack, (JavaScript, API + Markup), and some databases.
In 2021, I trained in a self-taught way, did my first bootcamp and found work as a Programmer, I was a semi-champion of HackTheSystem 🌟 based on my participation in the technology community. I like creating content on some platforms.
